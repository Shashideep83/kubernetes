## configuring weave net in master

**Saving the contents to weave file before installing CNI plugin** 
```
wget "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')" -O weave.yaml
```

Default ip range for weave net is from 10.32.0.0 to 10.47.255.255

**Before installing Weave Net, you should make sure the following ports are not blocked by your firewall: TCP 6783 and UDP 6783/6784.**

Weave Net can be installed onto your CNI-enabled Kubernetes cluster with this command:


```
kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

**We can allocate different ip's for weave net in following ways :**
- Give the range with `--ipalloc-range` in the command-line arguments to weave launch
- By modifying the downloaded weave.yaml file. Go to deamon set component of wave.yaml file and under the launch command add CIDR block range as parameter `--ipalloc-range=100.32.0.0/12` (shouldm't overlap with node ip range)
- `kubectl apply -f weave.yaml`



**After weave net is configured**:

- Node should be in ready state
- `kubectl get pod -n kube-system` core dns pods should also start running (`kubectl describe pod coredns-78fcd69978-ks78m -n kube-system`).
- A new pod weave net will also be displayed in kube-system node (`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`)



**To check ip addr of all pods in a node** - `kubectl get pod -n kube-system -o wide`
