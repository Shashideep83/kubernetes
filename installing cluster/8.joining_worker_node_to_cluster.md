## Joining worker nodes to cluster

Creation of token should happen only in master.

**Create token for joining worker node with master**:

- kubeadm token create (creates token)
- kubeadm token list
- kubeadm token create --print-join-command (outputs join command)
- sample join command `sudo kubeadm join 172.31.39.146:6443 --token <> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<>` 

**After worker nodes are connected with cluster**:

- We will see kube-proxy and weave nets daemons pods in kube-system namespace (`kubectl get pod -A -o wide`)


**Logs doesn't belong to a pod. It belongs to a contanier**

**Checking if weave net pods on all nodes are communicating :**
- Node should be in ready state (kubectl get pod -A  | grep weave -c weave (`get's pod names of weave net`)
- `kubectl get pod -n kube-system` core dns pods should also start running (`kubectl describe pod coredns-78fcd69978-ks78m -n kube-system`).
- A new pod weave net will also be displayed in kube-system node (`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`)
- logs to check`kubectl logs weave-net-gvx9t -n kube-system -c weave -f`
- check status of weave net pod - `kubectl exec -n kube-system weave-net-gvx9t -c weave -- /home/weave/weave --local status` 
**output** : 

- If pending and message in logs (`kubectl logs weave-net-gvx9t -n kube-system -c weave -f`): IP allocation was seeded by different peers, this means that some Weave Net peers were initialized into one cluster and some into another cluster; Weave Net cannot operate in this state.


- List itemTo recover, you need to eliminate the IPAM data from the affected nodes and restart. If you installed via the Kubernetes Addon, this data will be in a file under `/var/lib/weave` on the node - delete this file and restart the node.
